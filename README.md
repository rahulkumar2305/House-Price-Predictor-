# House-Price-Predictor-
"This project builds a machine learning model using features like area, bedrooms, and location to predict house prices accurately, providing real-time insights for buyers and sellers."
The House Price Predictor project focuses on building a machine learning model to estimate house prices based on key features such as area, number of bedrooms, and location. Traditionally, house price estimation is done manually, which can be inconsistent and prone to errors. By applying machine learning, this process can be automated to provide faster, more accurate, and reliable predictions.

The project starts with loading a dataset containing housing details. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing or inconsistent values. Numerical features such as area and bedrooms are scaled, while categorical features like location are encoded using OneHot Encoding. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model fairly.

A Linear Regression model is then trained to understand the relationship between housing features and prices. The performance of the model is measured using metrics such as the RÂ² Score, which indicates accuracy, and the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which shows prediction error.

Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and residual plots are included to analyze data patterns and validate model performance. Finally, the model is used for real-time predictions, making it a practical tool for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
